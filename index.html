    <h1><i>Welcome to my page!</i></h1>
    <p>Hello! This is Bradford A. Porter. This is a webpage for you to learn more about me and my experience at UGA thus far. I am a first generation college student,and want to be a role model for my younger sister. Growing up, my parents told me and my sister about college and how important it is to get an education. As I got older, I realized I wanted to stay in the state of Georgia for college. I was familar with UGA becuase of Georgia 4-H. Out of the eight schools I applied to, UGA was my top choice. I loved the campus, the different resouces and opportunities for students, and the football even if the team is not winning. </p>

 <p>  Through my different experiences at UGA,I have began thinking of what I want to do when I graduate. I possibly want to go to Graduate School either here or another SEC School for public adminstration and policy or student affairs. I am shakey on the idea of me going to law school which was my orgininal goal. When it come to career moves, I am interested in PR and Law so either a PR consultant at a Law Firm, or PR at College more than likely. I enjoy planning programs and events so I'm looking into jobs that could possibly combine all three.
